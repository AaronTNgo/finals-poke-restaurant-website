        We fell in love with poke at the first bite. Our vision has always been
        to bring the best poke from that island to our island. Our founder is a
        sushi master chef and currently owns a successful sushi restaurant in
        Long Island. And additionally, has years of working experience in one of
        the largest tuna fishing companies in the world. Poke has been heavily
        influenced by Japanese and other Asian cuisines. Our experience and
        background provides us with a thorough and deep understanding of Poke
        ‚Äúfrom pole to bowl‚Äù. It also gives us the ability to expand our horizons
        by opening this restaurant: Ohana Pok√©. With a passion for perfection,
        each day we select the freshest, most sustainable, sushi-grade fish.
        All of the other ingredients are seasonal and natural, creating
        contemporary flavors honoring the spirit of the poke traditions.

        Shortly after we opened our first Island poke restaurant in Roosevelt
        Field Mall, it became clear that people typically thought of ‚Äúthe poke
        bowl‚Äù as a raw fish meal served cold. We decided to change that and add
        cooked and hot items to the menu. New York has a long and cold winter,
        so we felt this was perfect for our local customers.

        Our menu was inspired by our trips to Hawaii and Japan, where we spent
        time researching and experiencing the cuisine. We developed a menu
        concept with poke, ramen, rice bowls, and sides like chicken karaage,
        pork gyoza, and shrimp tempura, to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>Ohana Poke is family friendly bussiness with healthy, tasty, and
        affordable food. Enjoy!
